## Description

This project is Module 18 challenge of U of U's professional bootcamp. This project uses Insomnia as an interface to traverse and manipulate databases. The databases are created using the Mongoose package. The project is a social networking API where users can be created and each user can post a thought, other users can then react to that thought. Adding friends functionality is not implemented at this time, but is the next step.
